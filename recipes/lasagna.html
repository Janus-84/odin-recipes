<p>Lasagna alone. In the plate, sadness ensues. Flat taste, no one near.</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
  <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
  <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
  <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
  <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
  <li>½ cup water</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</l>
  <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</l>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</l>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</l>
  <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</l>
  <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</l>
  <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</l>
  <li>12 lasagna noodles</l>
  <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</l>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
  <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>

  <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
  
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  
  <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
  
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
